# HydroLorica
Working on a new version of [Lorica](https://github.com/arnaudtemme/lorica) as the final project in CIS 625 - Concurrent Software Systems.

## Workflow
When making major changes, create a separate branch and make a pull request in order to merge it in. Generally use the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). Issues describing our needs might also be helpful, but aren't necessarily necessary.
